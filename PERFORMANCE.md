# Performance Optimizations for Zeniary Landing Page

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the Lighthouse performance score of the Zeniary landing page.

## Current Performance Issues

The Lighthouse performance score was around 64, with the following metrics:

- **Time to Interactive**: 7.5s (Poor) - Users must wait 7.5 seconds to interact with the page
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 4.2s (Poor) - Main content loading time exceeds the recommended 2.5 seconds
- **First Contentful Paint**: 1.9s (Moderate) - Acceptable but improvable
- **Speed Index**: 4.3s (Moderate) - Measures visual content display speed
- **Total Blocking Time**: 580ms (Moderate) - Indicates JavaScript execution is blocking the main thread

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Hero Component Optimization

- Reduced the number of animated paths from 36 to 12 to decrease initial rendering load
- Implemented client-side rendering for animations to avoid hydration issues
- Optimized animation transitions to reduce CPU usage

### 2. PostHog Analytics Optimization

- Disabled PostHog in development environment
- Implemented more aggressive deferral strategy using `requestIdleCallback` with longer timeouts
- Added request batching to reduce network requests
- Delayed pageview capture to prioritize rendering
- Limited element capturing to essential elements only

### 3. Performance Optimizer Component Enhancement

- Added DNS prefetch for non-critical domains
- Implemented image loading optimization with lazy loading and async decoding
- Added CSS loading optimization to defer non-critical stylesheets
- Improved JavaScript deferral with better timing strategies
- Used `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical operations

### 4. Next.js Configuration Optimization

- Increased image cache TTL from 60 to 3600 seconds
- Added HTTP headers for better caching of static assets
- Enabled compression for better performance
- Disabled the "Powered by" header
- Added security headers for better overall performance
- Enabled server actions for better performance

## Expected Improvements

These optimizations should address the key performance issues:

1. **Reduced Time to Interactive**: By deferring non-critical JavaScript and optimizing animations
2. **Improved Largest Contentful Paint**: By optimizing image loading and reducing initial render load
3. **Better First Contentful Paint**: By prioritizing critical CSS and deferring non-critical resources
4. **Improved Speed Index**: By optimizing the rendering process and reducing blocking resources
5. **Reduced Total Blocking Time**: By deferring JavaScript execution and using better timing strategies

## Monitoring and Future Improvements

To continue improving performance:

1. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly run Lighthouse audits to track improvements
2. **Optimize Images**: Consider further image optimization or implementing a CDN
3. **Code Splitting**: Implement more granular code splitting for better loading performance
4. **Preload Critical Resources**: Identify and preload critical resources for faster rendering
5. **Server-Side Rendering**: Consider implementing server-side rendering for critical components
