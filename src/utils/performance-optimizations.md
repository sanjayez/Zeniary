# Performance Optimizations for Zeniary Landing Page

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the Lighthouse score and overall user experience of the Zeniary landing page.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Component Lazy Loading

- **Implementation**: Used React's `Suspense` and `lazy` to defer loading of non-critical components
- **Benefits**: Reduces initial JavaScript bundle size and improves First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Added lazy loading for Dashboard, Features, and Privacy components

### 2. Image Optimization

- **Implementation**: Enhanced Next.js image configuration
- **Benefits**: Improves Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by optimizing image loading
- **Files Modified**:
  - `next.config.ts`: Added image optimization settings
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Added viewport and theme color metadata

### 3. Script Optimization

- **Implementation**: Created a PerformanceOptimizer component to defer non-critical scripts
- **Benefits**: Reduces Total Blocking Time (TBT) and improves Time to Interactive (TTI)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/components/common/PerformanceOptimizer.tsx`: New component
  - `src/app/ClientLayout.tsx`: Added the optimizer component

### 4. Analytics Optimization

- **Implementation**: Deferred PostHog loading and optimized its configuration
- **Benefits**: Reduces the performance impact of analytics
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/components/common/PosthogProvider.tsx`: Updated to defer loading

## Lighthouse Score Improvements

| Metric      | Before  | After               | Improvement |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Performance | 64      | ~90+ (expected)     | +26 points  |
| FCP         | 1,759ms | ~1,000ms (expected) | ~43% faster |
| LCP         | 3,133ms | ~2,000ms (expected) | ~36% faster |
| TTI         | 8,026ms | ~3,500ms (expected) | ~56% faster |
| TBT         | 881ms   | ~300ms (expected)   | ~66% faster |
| SI          | 4,753ms | ~2,500ms (expected) | ~47% faster |

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **New Components**: Use lazy loading for any new non-critical components
2. **Images**: Always use Next.js Image component with proper sizing and optimization
3. **Third-Party Scripts**: Add any new third-party domains to the preconnect list in PerformanceOptimizer
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Periodically run `next build --analyze` to identify large dependencies

## Further Optimization Opportunities

1. **Server Components**: Consider converting more components to React Server Components where possible
2. **Font Optimization**: Implement font subsetting to reduce font file sizes
3. **API Optimization**: Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns for data fetching
4. **CSS Optimization**: Consider moving to a CSS-in-JS solution with better tree-shaking

## Testing Performance

1. Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools regularly
2. Use [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) for production testing
3. Test on low-end devices and throttled connections
4. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
